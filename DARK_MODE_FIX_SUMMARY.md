# 🎉 DARK MODE ISSUE RESOLVED!

## ❌ **The Problem**

The dark mode toggle button wasn't working because:

1. **Tailwind CSS v4** was being used, which has **different dark mode configuration**
2. The `dark:` utility classes weren't being recognized or processed
3. CSS configuration was incompatible with v4's new approach

## ✅ **The Solution**

**Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3.4.0** which has stable, well-documented dark mode support:

### **Key Changes Made:**

1. **📦 Package Management:**

   ```bash
   npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss
   npm install tailwindcss@^3.4.0
   ```

2. **⚙️ Configuration Files:**

   - ✅ **PostCSS Config** (`postcss.config.mjs`):

     ```js
     plugins: {
       tailwindcss: {},
       autoprefixer: {},
     }
     ```

   - ✅ **Tailwind Config** (`tailwind.config.js`):

     ```js
     darkMode: 'class', // Enable class-based dark mode
     ```

   - ✅ **CSS Imports** (`globals.css`):
     ```css
     @tailwind base;
     @tailwind components;
     @tailwind utilities;
     ```

## 🚀 **Now Working Perfectly:**

### **✨ Global Theme Toggle:**

- **Fixed position** top-right corner on every page
- **Three options**: Light, Dark, System preference
- **Instant switching** with smooth transitions
- **Persistent storage** in localStorage

### **🎨 Universal Dark Mode:**
