    "Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine from India that focuses on balancing mind, body, and spirit. It uses natural remedies, diet, lifestyle practices, and herbal treatments. The three doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) are central concepts.",
  yoga: "Yoga combines physical postures (asanas), breathing exercises (pranayama), and meditation for overall wellness. Start with basic poses and focus on proper breathing. Regular practice brings flexibility, strength, and mental clarity.",
  meditation:
    "Meditation helps reduce stress and improve mental clarity. Start with 5-10 minutes daily, focusing on your breath. Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and gently return attention to breathing when your mind wanders.",
  dosha:
    "The three doshas are Vata (air/space - movement), Pitta (fire/water - metabolism), and Kapha (earth/water - structure). Each person has a unique constitution with one or more dominant doshas.",
  health:
    "For serious health concerns, please consult qualified healthcare professionals. Ayurveda emphasizes prevention through proper diet, daily routines, seasonal adjustments, and lifestyle practices suited to your constitution.",
  herbs:
    "Common Ayurvedic herbs include turmeric (anti-inflammatory), ashwagandha (stress relief), triphala (digestion), and tulsi (immunity). Always consult a practitioner before using herbs medicinally.",
  diet: "Ayurvedic nutrition emphasizes eating according to your dosha, seasonal foods, proper food combinations, and mindful eating. Warm, cooked foods are generally preferred over cold, raw foods.",
  default:
    "I'm currently having technical difficulties accessing my full knowledge base. For detailed Ayurvedic guidance, I recommend consulting with a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner or referring to authentic texts.",
